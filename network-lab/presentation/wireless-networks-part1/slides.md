# Security

- Why?
- WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
- WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
- WPA2
- WPA3

<!-- 
Why wireless communications secuirty matter? wire is a limit, it forces you to people who can connect to it in a radius, wireless communication lifts this limit, and with this limit lifted problems would arise, as nov this ease means ease of anyone in the range also connecting wireless network. this is concerning.

Initially, WEP aka Wired Equivalent Privacy, which was not even close to its claim, was introduced as de-facto and de-jury standard for Wifi Networks security, it used 64bit and 128bit keys (?which tech, why vulnerable?) had some serious issues, 

WPA or Wi-Fi Protected Access, was introduced as an intermediate measure while waiting for the full IEEE 802.11i standard. It totally replaced WEP and implemented the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP).

After that WPA tried to be even better building up on WPA success, plus, adhereing to the IEEE 802.11i standard and uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard which uses Rijndael algorithm) for encryption

WPA3, Introduced in 2018, addressed an array of security improvements overr WPA2, for example, Individualized Data Encryption: Each device has its own encryption key.
Protection Against Brute-Force Attacks: WPA3 makes it harder for attackers to guess passwords.
Enhanced Security for Open Networks: Even open (unencrypted) networks benefit from WPA3‚Äôs protections

If you wanna setup a wireless network today, ensure WPA2 or 3 is used, or else the chance of your networking being easily compermised is high, and always use complicated passwords, as an easy to guess password is always a bad idea, no matter how secure the backbone technology be.

# Alternatives

- Wi-Fi
- Bluetooth
- Z-wave

<!-- 

# Wi-fi

With all the case specific benitifs of Wifi, still many opt to it because of more support, as it doesnt need any spending on the hub, plus, its more compatible unlike Zigbee, which may end up not being compatible, unless its zigbee 3, but still we saw overtime improvement on ecosystems like wifi and bluetooth, so I guess the bigger problem is market, and if that be resolved, this would be solved overtime.

# Bluetooth

Bluetooth, tho slow, is pretty straight forward to pair, but also, unlike wifi and zigbee, its not exactly the most common option for networking, rather one to one communication which is another big problem for it.

# Z-Wave

Z-Wave is the cloest in the list to zigbee, used primarily for home automation just like zigbee. It operates on the 900 MHz frequency band and is known for its low power consumption and ability to create a mesh network for smart devices. its also a licensed service, which come with drawback of higher-price, but also with perk of being sure of compability across different devices supporting it.

- Examples:
  - Starlink new (27.5-30.0 GHz)
  - Satellite broadband and 5G backhaul
- Pros:
  - Ka-band offers even higher bandwidth and data rates compared to Ku-band, making it suitable for applications that require extremely fast data transmission.
  - Ka-band is less congested than Ku-band, with fewer existing users, making it easier to obtain licenses and ensure interference-free operation.
- Cons:
  - Ka-band signals are even more susceptible to interference from atmospheric conditions, such as rain and fog.
  - Ka-band requires even more precise antenna pointing and tracking due to its higher frequency.

# List
<!-- 
Ku-band (12-18 GHz): This frequency band is commonly used for satellite communications, including television broadcasting, satellite internet, and mobile backhaul. Starlink uses Ku-band frequencies for its initial launches, with a focus on the 12.2-12.7 GHz range.
Ka-band (26-40 GHz): This frequency band offers higher frequencies and more bandwidth than Ku-band, making it suitable for high-speed internet services. Starlink plans to use Ka-band frequencies for its later launches, with a focus on the 27.5-30.0 GHz range.
V-band (40-75 GHz): This frequency band is even higher than Ka-band and offers even more bandwidth. Some satellite constellations, like Amazon's Kuiper Systems, plan to use V-band frequencies for their services.
E-band (71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz): This frequency band is used for high-frequency, high-bandwidth applications, including satellite communications. Some satellite networks, like OneWeb, use E-band frequencies for their services.

<!--
Lynk, the US-based company mentioned earlier, operates in the L-band frequency range, specifically within the 1525 MHz to 1559 MHz and 1626.5 MHz to 1660.5 MHz bands. These frequency bands are designated for mobile satellite services (MSS) and are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States.

Lynk's L-band frequencies allow the company to provide global cellular connectivity using a constellation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, which communicate directly with standard, unmodified cell phones. By operating in the L-band, Lynk can offer lower latency and higher data rates compared to traditional satellite systems that operate in higher frequency bands, such as Ku or Ka.

Note:

* MEO stands for Medium Earth Orbit, which is between LEO and GEO.
* The number of satellites listed is approximate and may change over time.
* The orbit altitude listed is approximate and may vary depending on the specific satellite.
* The frequency band listed is not exhaustive, as some constellations may operate on multiple frequency bands.
* The speed and latency listed are approximate and may vary depending on the specific use case and user experience.

Keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list, and new players may enter the market as the satellite industry continues to evolve.

# Shiki Magic Move

Powered by [shiki-magic-move](https://shiki-magic-move.netlify.app/), Slidev supports animations across multiple code snippets.

Add multiple code blocks and wrap them with <code>````md magic-move</code> (four backticks) to enable the magic move. For example:

````md magic-move
```ts {*|2|*}
// step 1
const author = reactive({
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
})
```

```ts {*|1-2|3-4|3-4,8}
// step 2
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      author: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        books: [
          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
// step 3
export default {
  data: () => ({
    author: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      books: [
        'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
        'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
        'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
      ]
    }
  })
}
```

Non-code blocks are ignored.

```vue
<!-- step 4 
<script setup>
const author = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
